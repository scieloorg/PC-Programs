         <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
         <p>Lactase-florizine hydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.23/62), commonly known as lactase, is the intestinal enzyme that allows lactose digestion to yield its absorbable constituent monosaccharides, glucose and galactose<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>)</sup>. This ability persists throughout adulthood only in a minority of human subjects, resulting in the lactase persistence (LP) phenotype, while lactase enzyme is significantly reduced after weaning in most adults worldwide, resulting in lactase non-persistence or adult-type hypolactasia (ATH) phenotype<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>)</sup>. Both conditions are genetically determined and their frequencies vary in human populations according to geographical and ethnic variations<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>The direct method to diagnose ATH is to assay lactase activity in intestinal biopsies<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>)</sup>. However, a non invasive method, the hydrogen breath test after lactose ingestion, allows to indirectly determine the phenotype with high sensitivity and specificity<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>)</sup>. With the discovery of phenotype-genotype association in the past few years, a direct genetic diagnostic method becomes relevant. In fact, genotyping of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C/T<sub>-13910</sub>, located upstream of the lactase gene (LCT), has shown that CC-genotype is associated with ATH phenotype, whereas the TC and TT-genotypes are associated with LP phenotype in Europeans of Caucasian origin<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>Taking into account the relevance of the genetic test as a predictor of ATH in some Europeans populations and the European contribution to the ethnic admixture of the Colombian Caribbean population, the purpose of this study was to compare the lactose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) with the genetic test in order to ascertain the applicability of genotyping to diagnose LP/ATH in a Colombian Caribbean population.</p>

            <title>Subjects</title>
            <p>A group of 128 healthy individuals, men and women (mean age 35 ± 1; range 17-69 years) without family ties among them, born in the Colombian Caribbean were selected. Their parents and grandparents were also born in this geographical zone. None of the individuals were smokers, showed digestive disease, had undergone abdominal surgery nor had undergone antibiotic treatment within the last 3 months preceding the study.</p>
            <p>The subjects gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidad Libre of Barranquilla, Colombia.</p>

            <title>Lactose hydrogen breath test (LHBT)</title>
            <p>The LHBT was performed after ingestion of 250 mL of 10% lactose. Ten-hours of fasting were required before testing. The breath hydrogen level was detected by Microlyzer Quintron Model 12i plus (Quintron Instrument Company Inc., Milwaukee, USA) at baseline and after the ingestion of lactose every hour over a period of 3 hours. The LHBT was considered positive if the hydrogen production was equal to or above 20 ppm compared to baseline in any measurement during the 3 hours after the ingestion of lactose. A positive LHBT showed that the subject was lactose maldigester (hypolactasia)<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>)</sup>.</p>

            </title>
            <p>DNA was obtained from venous blood using the Wizard<sup>(r)</sup> Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, USA). Polymorphism identification was done by Polymerase Chain Reaction/Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR/RFLP). The fragment was amplified using the primers: 5'-GCTGGCAATACAGATAAGATAATGGA-3' and 5'-CTGCTTTGGTTGAAGCGAAGAT-3'<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>)</sup>. Reaction was carried out in a total volume of 20 µL, with Tris HCl buffer 1X pH 9.0; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.5 mM; dNTPs 0.2 mM; Taq polymerase 1.5U and 1 µM for each primer (Invitrogen<sup>(r)</sup>, USA). PCR conditions were: 95°C for 10 min (denaturation cycle), followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 59°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, and a final elongation cycle at 72°C for 8 min. PCR product was digested with Hinf I (New England Biolabs) generating fragments of 177 and 24 bp. Amplification and digestion products were run in an 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fragments were visualized with ethidium bromide stain. Samples that only presented a 201 bp (C) fragment or a 177 bp (T) fragment were interpreted as CC and TT genotype, respectively. While samples that presented two fragments of 201 bp and 177 bp, were interpreted as the CT genotype. The 24 bp fragment was not visualized.</p>

         <title>DISCUSSION</title>
         <p>In this study, no close correlation between the CT genotype and the digesters (LP) or between CC genotype and the maldigesters (ATH) was found. The genetic test showed high sensitivity (97%) but low specificity (46%) and poor positive predictive value (71%). These last data suggest that the probability that a subject with a positive hypolactasia result actually has this genetic condition is not high, which means that the test is susceptible to false positives and is inconsistent compared to the LHBT for the ATH diagnosis in the studied population.</p>
         <p>The results of this study differ from those of Di Stefano et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>)</sup>, Hogenauer et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>)</sup>, Krawczyk et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>)</sup>, Nagy et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>)</sup>, and Pohl et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>)</sup>, carried out on European populations which showed strong agreement between LHBT and the genetic studies. It is possible that the discrepancy can be due to the genetic heterogeneity of the Colombian Caribbean population that arose from the crossing of different races as opposed to the studies with Europeans with Caucasian descent only<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>)</sup>. Racial difference has implications on the genotypes that are reflected on the distribution of lactase phenotypes. In Europeans, the most common phenotype (lactase persistence) is strongly associated with the dominant and most prevalent -13910*T allele due to strong positive selection; but the ATH phenotype is rare and it is associated with the recessive and less prevalent -13910*C allele<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>, 1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>)</sup>. In people of mixed ancestry, the genetic influence of their racial background is reflected. Thus, the low frequency of the -13910T allele found in the present study most likely represents the European contribution to the mixture of the three main ethnicities of the Colombian Caribbean people, whereas the high frequency of -13910C allele would represent the contribution from the other two ethnicities (Amerindians and Africans)<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>The above hypothesis agrees with the Torniainen et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>)</sup> and Mattar et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>)</sup> studies. The former found in South Africa and Ghana that both -13910*T and -14010*C alleles reflected the contribution from Europeans and Africans in mixed ancestry subjects, respectively; the latter study reported that the lactase persistence allele (-13910*T) in mestizos subjects, product of white and African-Brazilian interbreeding, is present not only as a consequence of the European contribution but also of the ancestral contribution of Africans who have that allele<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>)</sup>. This is not the case for African Caribbean Colombians, because the blacks brought as slaves from Africa during the colonial period came mainly from Western Africa where the -13910*T allele is scarce<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>The importance of the ethnic origin, when doing genotype-phenotype correlation studies is evident with the results recently published in Brazil by Bulhões et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>)</sup> and Mattar et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>)</sup> who reported perfect correlation between the SNP C/T<sub>-13910</sub> and lactose digestion. They got this result because the subjects in their study were Brazilians of Caucasian descendence.</p>
         <p>On the other hand, the low prevalence of -13910*T allele found in Colombian Caribbean population would indicate that some different lactase persistence associated allele is present in the population studied. Indeed, the C/G<sub>-13907</sub>, T/C<sub>-13913</sub>, G/C<sub>-14010</sub> and T/G<sub>-13915</sub> polymorphisms, all of them located upstream of the LCT gene, have been identified in some African and Middle Eastern populations<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, 28)</sup>. This finding shows that the genotyping of C/T-13910, valid as a diagnostic resource for Northern Europeans, does not apply worldwide<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>It would be interesting to verify if those polymorphisms found in African populations are associated with LP/ATH in the Colombian Caribbean population, because of its African ancestry. Likewise, since the heterogeneity has implications on the lactase genotypes, new studies about the true contribution of Blacks, Spanish and Amerindians to the genetic structure of the population being studied are necessary.</p>
         <p>In our study, no subjects had lactose intolerance symptoms such as diarrhea or abdominal distention at the time of the LBHT test. It would be interesting to study a group of symptomatic Colombian Caribbean subjects and correlate the lactose test with the -13910 polymorphism.</p>

         <title>CONCLUSION</title>
         <p>In a sample of the Colombian Caribbean population, no close correlation between the genotyping of the SNP C/T<sub>-13910</sub> polymorphism and the LHBT was found. From these findings we conclude that the genetic test is not reliable to diagnose ATH/lactase persistence in Colombian Caribbean subjects.</p>
