         <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
         <p>Protein caloric malnutrition is a syndrome considered as progressive loss of both lean body mass (protein) and adipose tissue (calorie). Significant changes in the metabolism of protein, carbohydrates and lipids appear simultaneously the consumption of muscular and lipid compartments to satisfy a higher energetic demand<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>)</sup>. This clinical condition is common in patients with chronic hepatopathy and affects 20% of the patients with compensated cirrhosis and more than 60% of these patients with severe hepatic dysfunction<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>Several factors are present in the development of malnutrition in cirrhotic. Inadequate oral ingestion resulting from anorexia, dysgeusia, early satiety, nauseas and vomits associated with hepatopathy, use of drugs and their adverse effects<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>)</sup>. We should also consider as contributing factors the poor absorption and deficient intestinal digestion, which are more accentuated in patients with bile duct diseases with cholestasis, for whom steatorrhea is common<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>Malnutrition is a relevant factor when determining the progress of hepatic disease, as it affects the storage of nutrients, contributes to hypoalbuminemia resulting from impaired hepatic synthesis and intensifies the hydroelectrolytic unbalance determined by renal alterations, characteristics of this disease state<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>)</sup>. However, it involves difficulties and controversies regarding the identification of the best nutritional assessment method considered as gold standard, that is a low cost, loyal and easy-to-apply method that does not affect the final result.</p>
         <p>Due to these characteristics, which negatively interfere in the nutritional status of the cirrhotic patient and which are part of the natural history of the disease, it is necessary to identify when malnutrition begins its course.</p>
         <p>This preventive measure applies primarily to patients on the liver transplant list, who will thus have a better quality of life until the time of the transplant.</p>
         <p>Therefore, the present study has the purpose of identifying amongst the available methods, of low cost and easily reproducible, which one offers a safe and efficient nutritional diagnosis, which will help the clinical practice and allow an early intervention in cirrhotic patients.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="materials|methods">
         <title>METHODS</title>
         <p>A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2007 and January 2008 with 129 cirrhotic patients, with diagnosis based on histological evidences, clinical and laboratorial or imaging diagnosis (presence of hepatic irregularities due to portal hypertension and hepatic insufficiency) and evidences of chronic hepatic disease. The clinical evidences of cirrhosis were defined with the presence of portal hypertension or hepatic insufficiency.</p>
         <p>The study excluded patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, poor intestinal absorption, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, use of enteral diet, neuromuscular alterations in upper limbs, chronic pancreatitis, chronic diarrhea and psychic and/or cognitive alterations.</p>
         <p>The patients with inclusion criteria were classified according to the disease severity through Child-Pugh score. They were invited to participate in the study after they agreed with it and signed the Informed Consent Term, approved by the ethics committee of the Universidade Federal de Ciências da Saúde de Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), RS, Brazil.</p>
         <sec>
            <title>Protocol</title>
            <p>The clinical, anthropometric, subjective global assessments was performed through dynamometry and bioelectrical impedance during a routine doctor's visit, in the morning shift, with the same duration and performed by the same appraiser.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec>
            <title>Anthropometry</title>
            <p>Weight was measured using a Filizola 100 g resolution scale and height with a wall-mounted stadiometer. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula proposed by Quetelet<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>)</sup>, BMI = weight/height2; and the parameters of OMS 1995<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>)</sup> were considered for the nutritional state classification.</p>
            <p>The triceps skinfold (TSF) and upper arm circumference (UAC) were measured using mathematical formulas to calculate the arm muscle circumference (AMC)<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>)</sup>. Measurement of TSF was measured using a Cescorf skinfold caliper. The UAC was measured with a graduated, non-retracting, flexible measuring tape.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec>
            <title>Subjective global assessment</title>
            <p>The subjective global assessment (SGA) was performed following the protocol of Detsky et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>)</sup>. It analyzed history data of ponderal loss, reduced daily caloric ingestion, gastrointestinal symptoms, functional capacity and physical signs of malnutrition (reduction of subcutaneous tissue and/or muscular mass, edema, ascites). The patients were classified as: well nourished A, with moderate malnutrition B and severe malnutrition C, according to the method scores.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec>
            <title>Dynamometry</title>
            <p>A mechanical hand grip dynamometer of adjustable handle was used to assess the hand grip strength (HGS) (Baseline(r) Smedley Spring, made in New York, USA). The patient sits on a chair without armrest and with the plantar region on the floor; the appraiser adjusts the dynamometer handle to place the patient's hand comfortably, that, during the test, should be kept far from the body and chair. After the dynamometer adjustment to the correct position, the patient compresses the handle with as much strength as possible with the non-dominant hand.</p>
            <p>Three assessments were made, with an interval of more than 30 seconds between them, and the pointer was zeroed after each attempt. The result of highest value from the three assessments was utilized as criterion-result, and later the nutritional state was classified along with the patient's age and gender, according to the reference parameter of Álvares da Silva et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec>
            <title>Bioelectrical impedance</title>
            <p>For the assessment of nutritional state, Biodynamics, model 450, Seattle, WA, USA was utilized. The patient remains in dorsal decubitus position, with hands and legs parallel to the body. One electrode is placed on the dorsal hand, at the middle finger level, and one in the wrist joint, both on the right side. Another pair of electrodes is placed on the dorsal foot, at the middle toe level, and in the ankle joint, also on the right side.</p>
            <p>The electrical current used in the measurement is 800 A and 50 kHz, which enables to measure resistance and reactance and obtain the phase angle (PA) value.</p>
            <p>The PA derives from two segments of corporal composition, calculated as follows: PA = tangent arc (Xc /R) x 180/ 3.1416, proposed by Barbosa-Silva et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>)</sup>. The PA result enables to classify the patient according his/her nutritional state.</p>
            <p>The patients were classified according to two reference parameters: the first is named bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), based on the reference parameters of the study conducted by Barbosa-Silva et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>)</sup>, which validated cutoff points for the method, according to the age and gender of a population of inpatients with different diseases from an American hospital; the second one, BIA cirrhosis, named by the author of this study, is related to the population of cirrhotic patients included in this study and presents the value of 5.44º as cutoff point.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec>
            <title>Statistical analysis</title>
            <p>A descriptive analysis was performed through mean values and standard deviation for continuous variables of symmetric distribution, or median value and interquartile amplitude for continuous variables of asymmetric distribution, and absolute and relative frequency for categorical variables.</p>
            <p>Chi-square test of McNemar was used in the comparison of the nutritional state between the techniques.</p>
            <p>Kappa coefficient of agreement was used to assess the agreement between the classifications of BIA.</p>
            <p>The assessment of the association between the reference values of HGS and BIA and severity, disease etiology and demographic characteristics used the <italic>t</italic>-Student test or the analysis of variance (ANOVA), one way for continuous variables of symmetric distribution, and Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables of asymmetric distribution. For multiple comparisons, Tukey test (symmetric distribution) or Mann-Whitney test (asymmetric distribution) was used.</p>
            <p>Pearson's chi-square test was used to assess the association between the categorical variables.</p>
            <p>The significance level of 5% was considered and the analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 13.0.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec>
            <title>Ethical considerations</title>
            <p>Secrecy was maintained about the identity and data from all patients submitted to the assessment protocol (number: 06/135). The study was conducted after the approval of the Ethics Committee, according to the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, revision of 1983.</p>

         <title>DISCUSSION</title>
         <p>This study was conducted at an outpatient clinic, with most patients clinically classified as Child-Pugh A and B; the small group classified as Child-Pugh C might affect data accuracy. Another limitation of this study was the failure to include a control group.</p>
         <p>The malnutrition percentages of 11.6% obtained through TSF and 13.2% through AMC disagree with the percentages of Abbott et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>)</sup> and Alberino et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>)</sup>, which show 54% of malnourished patients when combining the two methods, and of Merli et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>)</sup>, which suggest AMC as an indicator of severe malnutrition in patients in the end stage of cirrhosis. The prevalence of overweight was identified in the studied population, when analyzing the BMI, which may present a strong relation with the clinical conditions of the patient, due to water retention and ascites.</p>
         <p>Through SGA, 20.2% of the patients in this study were classified as malnourished; in the study conducted by Gottschall et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>)</sup> with a similar population, the index achieved 38%. SGA presents sensitivity of 22% in patients with cirrhosis and underestimates the nutritional state of this population in 57%, with overestimation of 6%<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>)</sup>. Paradoxically, some studies suggest that the benefits of SGA for the nutritional state progress of candidates for kidney transplantation, while other studies showed that SGA detects malnutrition in only 25% of the cases<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>)</sup>. However, it should be noted that SGA is an instrument composed of quantitative and qualitative variables, subject to varied interpretations, as it is a partially subjective method.</p>
         <p>In agreement with the literature, the method that presented the highest proportion of malnourished patients was HGS, with 69.3% of the cases. Álvares-da-Silva et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>)</sup> observe that the method presents the capacity to detect 100% of the malnutrition cases and, according to Norman et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>)</sup>, identifies the nutritional risk before the serious state of malnutrition. In the evaluation of cirrhotic patients hospitalized, HGS presents the best relation with the nutritional state progress of the cirrhotic patient, as in the study, 89% of the malnourished patients were classified as Child-Pugh B and C<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>This study demonstrated that HGS does not present statistically significant relation with the Child-Pugh classification, described here as a parameter for the clinical condition of the patient with chronic hepatic disease. Knowing that patients classified as Child C are malnourished by definition<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>)</sup>, the study observed the highest percentage of malnourished patients (93.2%), classified through HGS as Child A and B, and only 6.8% as Child C, reinforcing the non-relation with Child-Pugh.</p>
         <p>The study used the reference parameters for HGS, validated by Álvares-da-Silva et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>)</sup>, with healthy individuals. A discrepancy was observed when comparing it to the values found in the population of cirrhotic patients, a factor that might have contributed to overestimated proportion of cirrhotic patients.</p>
         <p>Regarding the utilization of BIA, a study with cirrhotic patients, divided into patients with and without ascites, Pirlich et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>)</sup> report that this is not the clinical sign of greatest negative impact for the corporal composition determination. The authors suggest that specific values and equations to cirrhotic patients should be created as a reference parameter for the utilization of bioelectrical impedance assessment.</p>
         <p>Lee and Gallagher<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>)</sup> compare BIA to other high-cost methods, such as bone densitometry, computed tomography and magnetic resonance, in an attempt to identify a low-cost effective method to assess the human corporal composition. This study concludes that BIA presents poor accuracy in individual or group assessments, but effective for a specific population, i.e., individuals without corporal alterations. Lehnert et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>)</sup> suggest the use of this method in a serial form, identifying and following the cirrhotic patient's nutritional state evolution.</p>
         <p>The meta-analysis of Kyle et al. <sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>)</sup> describes that BIA is not an adequate method to patients that present many alterations in the corporal geometric composition, illustrating it with individuals with ascites. The same meta-analysis suggests the use of BIA in a segmental form. Another hypothesis studied is the indication of BIA for nutritional assessment, using the phase angle as a reference value for the method and analyzing the cellularity of the individual impacted by the disease. Schwenk et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>)</sup> suggest the phase angle as a global marker for malnourished individuals infected with HIV and discuss that the phase angle reflects the integrity and vitality of the cell membrane.</p>
         <p>Gupta et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>)</sup> demonstrate that the phase angle is more powerful indicator of survival than the traditional parameters of nutritional assessment, presenting a cutoff point for phase angle of 5.0º, for patients with pancreatic cancer.</p>
         <p>Studies demonstrated the correlation of the phase angle as a good prognostic indicator in severe clinical situations<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>)</sup>. Another study that also evaluated patients with chronic hepatic diseases, presented the cutoff point of 5.4º for the phase angle<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>)</sup>. Coincidently, our study found a similar cutoff point of 5.44º to characterize malnutrition.</p>
         <p>Norman et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>)</sup> describe in their study of BIA evaluation in nutritional diagnosis, the phase angle as a poor indicator of survival.</p>
         <p>BIA, through the phase angle, was the only method that presented a statistically significant relation with Child-Pugh. However, due to the limitation of this study in terms of low number of patients sorted as Child-Pugh C and age group of 20-39 years, it was not possible to validate a specific reference parameter for this population, dividing them by age, gender and Child-Pugh.</p>
         <p>However, this limitation does not invalidate our findings with regard to the values of phase angle and to the agreement with the patient's clinical condition by Child-Pugh score. We show this agreement through the results of phase angle, by obtaining the same cutoff point as studies by L. Scheunemann et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>)</sup> and Wagner et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>)</sup>. Given this fact, the phase angle is a strong prognostic marker regardless of the pathology, since this method evaluates cell capacitance, i.e., the integrity and functionality of the individual's cell, unlike other methods routinely used for nutritional diagnosis, which are usually based on the patient's body weight. In our case, this parameter is error-prone.</p>
         <p>Based on such data, the total 34.1% of malnourished patients were found through BIA. The study conducted by Barbosa-Silva et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>)</sup> was used as the reference parameter, which validates the reference values for the phase angle, for the population of patients from an American hospital, dividing them by age and gender. These results agree with the findings of our study, classifying malnutrition in 33.3% of the sample through BIA cirrhosis, using the phase angle of 5.44º, with agreement of 80.6% between them.</p>
         <p>Although no gold standard is said to exist for the assessment of the nutritional state of cirrhotic patients, we suggest future studies using BIA, as it showed a low margin of error, when compared to the other methods. BIA was the only method to present a significant relation with Child-Pugh, age group and gender for chronic hepatic diseases.</p>
         <p>Figueiredo et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>)</sup> suggest that the four-compartment model of assessment, provided by a CT scan, might be sensitive in detecting malnutrition even in early stages of the disease. However, this method is costly and of low reproducibility for assessing the nutritional status of patients and, therefore, it was not used in our research, as it did not fulfill one of the purposes of the study.</p>

         <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
         <p>The assessment of the nutritional status of cirrhotic patients and the comparison with different methods show marked discrepancies, with the percentage of malnourished patients ranging from 5.4% to 68.2%.</p>
         <p>HGS and BIA showed a very high variation, with malnutrition percentages of 68.2% to 34.1%, respectively.</p>
         <p>In the comparison to Child-Pugh score, BIA was the only method that showed to be statistically significant.</p>
         <p>The identification of the phase angle of 5.44º is the new parameter suggested for the classification of the nutritional state of the cirrhotic patient, which can be named BIA Cirrhosis. However, more studies are needed to confirm these data, particularly expanding the number of cases of patients rated as Child-Pugh C.</p>
