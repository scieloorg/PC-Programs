         <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
         <p>Obesity is considered to be a growing problem in modern society and its prevalence has been increasing in both developed and developing countries<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>Most types of bariatric surgery include resection, sutures or partial stomach exclusion. The most frequent bariatric surgery is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), which involves partial exclusion of the stomach<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>Mucosal alterations after vertical banded RYGBP have not been clearly evaluated because the excluded stomach is not easily reached by conventional endoscopy<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>)</sup>.</p>

The eradication of the <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> leads to a regression of the inflammatory process of the gastric mucosa, the same does not happen in the more advanced stages, with the presence of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>, 2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>The present study aims to evaluate the prevalence of endoscopic findings and gastric histopathological alterations in morbidly obese patients.

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>)</sup> with indication for bariatric surgery by significant co-morbidities. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGI) and gastric biopsies was required in the preoperative period. The patients had not undergone UGI or treatment to eradicate <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylory</italic>
            </named-content> previously. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Conceição, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, and all patients gave informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. The upper endoscopies were realized by the same gastroenterologist with a video-endoscope Fujinon series 400. Four gastric biopsies were carried out, two in the body and two in the antrum, always in the greater gastric curvature. Los Angeles and Sydney classification were used in the endoscopic analysis of esophagitis and gastritis<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>Alterations of the gastric mucosa were classified by the pathologist as an inflammatory process through the presence of lymphocytic and plasmocytic cells and inflammatory activity through the presence of neutrophils. Lymphoid hyperplasia, presence of <named-content content-type="scientific-name">

         <title>DISCUSSION</title>
         <p>The prevalence of obese individuals in USA (defined as BMI&gt;30 kg/m<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>)</sup> has increased from 15.3% to 23.9% in the period of 1995 to 2005 and the prevalence of morbidly obese individuals (BMI&gt;40 kg/m<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>)</sup> was of 4.8% in 2005<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>The most performed bariatric procedure is the RYGBP, which involves the exclusion of a significant part of the stomach. Lesions of the excluded stomach have been reported and the diagnosis of this possibility is difficult, onerous, not always available and, as a result of that, gastric diseases, such as ulcers and malignant neoplasms in the excluded stomach may not be diagnosed<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>)</sup>.</p>

               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> is associated to gastric diseases, such gastritis, ulcer, epithelial atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, lymphoma, adenocarcinoma<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>)</sup>. The prevalence of infection caused by the <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> in Latin America is around 60%, varying from 30% to 90%<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>)</sup>.</p>

               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> causes inflammation of the gastric mucosa in all infected individuals<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>)</sup>. This inflammation consists initially in recruitment of neutrophils, followed by lymphocytes, with later epithelial damage<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>)</sup>. The chronic inflammatory process increases the turnover of epithelial cells and apoptosis (cellular death), evolving to epithelial atrophy and intestinal metaplasia<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>The development of gastric cancer involves several stages and can start with chronic gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and finally invasive cancer<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>)</sup>. The World Health Organization concluded, in 1994, for the existence of epidemiological and histological evidences to classify the <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> as carcinogenic, group 1<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>)</sup>. Studies have shown the increased incidence of gastric cancer in the population infected by the <named-content content-type="scientific-name">

            </named-content>, as well as a positive correlation between intestinal metaplasia and stomach cancer<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>Eradication of the <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> leads to a regression of the inflammation, reduction of cellular turnover, increase in the acid secretion, which are important factors for the prevention of gastric cancer<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>)</sup>. Some studies have concluded for the irreversibility of the carcinogenic process, even with the eradication of the <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori,</italic>
            </named-content> basically when intestinal metaplasia of the stomach was present<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>The incidence of stomach cancer is still now a frequent causes in the group of world malignant neoplasm, being an important cause of mortality<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>)</sup>. Few cases of gastric cancer in the bypassed stomach have been described after RYGBP for morbid obesity<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>)</sup>. Factors such as difficulty of access to the excluded stomach and the reduced number of patients with adequate follow-up after bariatric surgery can interfere in this analysis.</p>
         <p>The rationale for performing UGI in the candidates to bariatric surgery is to detect and treat lesions that might potentially lead to complications in the immediate postoperative period, or result in diseases in the months or years following RYGBP surgery<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>Eradication of the <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> as a routine in the pre-operative of bariatric surgery is still debated and scarce researches were performed in regards the histology of gastric mucosa<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>6, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>Mong et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>)</sup> studied 272 patients who were candidates to bariatric surgery, in which 33 (12%) showed lesions in the upper digestive tract. Endoscopic findings were: esophagitis in 3.7%; Barrett's esophagus in 3.7%; gastric ulcer and/or erosive gastritis in 3.2%; duodenal ulcer in 0.7% and gastric carcinoid tumor in 0.3%.</p>
         <p>Muñoz et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>)</sup> diagnosed UGI abnormalities in 46% in the obese patients, one of them with gastric cancer.</p>
         <p>Dutta et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>)</sup> found prevalence of gastric ulcer of 2.9%, identified histologically gastritis in 23.7% and <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> in 6.9% in the obese patients, finding that was not different from the control (non-obese) patients.</p>
         <p>Safatle-Ribeiro et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>)</sup> examined the excluded stomach in 40 patients by enteroscopy in an average of 78 months after surgery. In this study, an inflammatory process in the gastric mucosa was diagnosed in 100% of the cases, atrophy in 14%, intestinal metaplasia in 11.4 % and infection by the <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> in 20%. All cases of <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> infection in the excluded stomach also had the same infection in the gastric functional pouch.</p>
         <p>A review of the literature revealed that the preoperative prevalence of <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> ranges from 6.9% to 61.3% in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, 1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>9, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, 3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>)</sup>.</p>
         <p>In the present study, there were 73 (57.9%) cases with abnormalities in upper digestive endoscopy and 53 (42.1%) patients with normal UGI. In 42 cases (33.3%) gastroduodenal abnormalities were diagnosed, like exudative/enanthematous gastritis, erosive gastritis, gastric or duodenal ulcers. Approximately 50% of the obese patients showed inflammatory activity and infection by the <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> and 16% had atrophy and/or intestinal metaplasia in gastric mucosa. The absence of <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> infection does not rule out gastric metaplasia or atrophy.</p>
         <p>The prevalence of <named-content content-type="scientific-name">
               <italic>H. pylori</italic>
            </named-content> infection and gastric atrophy and/or intestinal metaplasia in obese patients with gastric or duodenal lesions at endoscopy, comparatively with obese patients with normal stomach or duodenal at UGI, was not statistical different (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05).</p>
         <p>The long-term follow-up of patients submitted to RYGBP may probably clarify if histopathological abnormalities of the gastric mucosa diagnosed prior surgery could interfere in the postoperative complications or in risk of gastric cancer.</p>
