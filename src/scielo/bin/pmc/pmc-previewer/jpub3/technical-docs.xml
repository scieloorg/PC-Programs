    <p>This document provides technical information regarding the HTML and PDF Preview stylesheets
      for the NLM/NCBI Journal Publishing 3.0 tag set. (See <ext-link
        xlink:href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/"
        >http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/</ext-link>.) It is intended for technical users, that
      is, personnel responsible for installing, configuring, and maintaining or extending these
      stylesheets. For information intended for general users regarding the scope and application of
      these stylesheets, see the User's Guide in this distribution. For instructions on how to run
      these stylesheets on Journal Publishing content using a basic configuration, see the Quick
      Start Guide.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>General overview</title>
      <p>The various tasks performed by stylesheets in this distribution have been distinguished so
        they may be mixed and matched to meet specific local requirements, including:</p>
      <list>
        <list-item>
          <p>Generating either HTML, PDF or XHTML output.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Autoformatting of structured citation elements
            <monospace>(element-citation</monospace>) according to different sets of guidelines (we
            include stylesheets supporting the NLM/Pubmed citation style and an APA-like citation
            style).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Filtering content based on the values of <monospace>specific-use</monospace> attributes
            assigned to elements in the source data.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>These various operations are performed in stages as follows:</p>
      <def-list>
        <def-item>
          <term>Preprocesses</term>
          <def>
            <p>Preprocesses are all designed to perform operations needed by some processes but not
              others, so they can be excluded when not needed. Generally speaking it is possible to
              run more than one preprocess, as long as they do not directly conflict with one
              another. When they do, it can be expected that the first process in the chain to
              handle a particular element or structure in the input will be the one to take
              effect.</p>
            <p>All preprocessing stylesheets accept arbitrary (valid) Journal Publishing 3.0 XML and
              emit the same format: they are "modified identity transformations", whose operations
              are limited to a particular subset of elements related to their functional
              requirements.</p>
            <p>Because some preprocesses perform operations that are not practically achieved in
              modifiable, maintainable XSLT 1.0, they use XSLT 2.0 and require an XSLT 2.0
              processor. Others will work in either an XSLT 1.0 or 2.0 processor.</p>
            <p>Brief descriptions of each preprocess appear below. Additionally, all stylesheets in
              this package are documented internally.</p>
          </def>
        </def-item>
        <def-item>
          <term>Main preview processes</term>
          <def>
            <p>There are two preview stylesheets in this distribution.
                <monospace>jpub3-html.xsl</monospace> formats Journal Publishing 3.0 in HTML for
              display in web browsers.<fn>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to tradeoffs forced by discrepancies in their modeling of
                  block vs inline elements in the Journal Publishing tag set and HTML, not all
                  results of the HTML preview stylesheet can be guaranteed to be valid HTML. But
                  none of the known issues have hindered correct rendering in browsers.</p>
              </fn>
              <monospace>jpub3-xslfo.xsl</monospace> converts Journal Publishing 3.0 XML into XSL
              formatting objects, ready for rendering by an XSL formatting engine into PDF
              output.</p>
            <p>Both main preview stylesheets accept a filtered form of Journal Publishing 3.0, in
              which structured citation elements have been replaced with formatted citations. The
              assumption here is that all processes will need to include some form of citation
              processing in order to format citations in an appropriate style. For purposes of this
              documentation, this filtered form can be called "Simple citation" Journal Publishing
              3.0 (it is specified in more detail below). Some projects may have citations that are
              already formatted using <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace> elements, which provides
              for inline punctuation and hence formatting within the source data. Since all the
              citation preprocessors respect punctuation that is already in place, any of them may
              be used as the preprocessor in such cases.</p>
            <p>If input data should happen already to conform to the "Simple citation" format, a
              citation preprocessor may be dispensed with altogether. Some projects may wish to do
              this — "unbundling" the citation formatting to manage it up front or by different
              means altogether — in order to be able to use a wider range of XSLT processors,
              including XSLT processors in web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox or
              Safari, to render their previews directly. The main preview stylesheets are
              implemented in XSLT 1.0 in order to enable this.</p>
          </def>
        </def-item>
        <def-item>
          <term>Post-process</term>
          <def>
            <p>Because some Journal Publishing 3.0 data may include MathML, the rendering of MathML
              may be an issue. The PDF preview stylesheet simply passes MathML through to be
              rendered by the formatter; many commercial FO engines now support MathML. On the HTML
              side, however, things are more complex since MathML is not supported by generic web
              browsers displaying HTML.</p>
            <p>Some current browsers now support MathML display in XHTML output. For these purposes,
              an HTML to XHTML converter has been provided as a post-process. More details are
              provided below.</p>
          </def>
        </def-item>
      </def-list>
      <sec>
        <title>Stylesheets in this package</title>
        <p>While the preview stylesheets in this distribution are intended as fairly comprehensive
          solutions, the supporting stylesheets may serve simply as demonstrations of how to achieve
          common tasks. Projects should feel free to copy, modify or extend any of them in order to
          support local requirements better.</p>

      <title>Running the stylesheets</title>
      <p>Stylesheets included in this distribution make it possible to run processing pipelines
        easily. For various reasons, users and publishers may wish to modify these methods.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Using the provided shell stylesheets</title>
        <p>The easiest way to apply either of the preview stylesheets is to use one of the shell
          ("wrapper") stylesheets with Saxon, the XSLT 2.0 engine, as described in the Quick Start
          and User guides. The shell stylesheets use Saxon extensions to apply a set of
          transformations in sequence quickly, with a minimum of memory or disk overhead. Each one
          calls one or the other main preview stylesheet, with different pre- or postprocessors
          depending on its intended application.</p>
        <p>As delivered, each shell stylesheet provided also depends on the module
            <monospace>main/shell-utility.xsl</monospace> to function. This module must be in place,
          and its location in relation to the stylesheets named in the shell must be stable, for
          things to work.</p>
        <p>Because running the XSL-FO previews stylesheet also entails running an XSL-FO formatter,
          there are slightly different considerations in setting this up for each type of
          output:</p>
        <sec>
          <title>HTML preview pipeline</title>
          <p>Either from the command line or using an XML editor or XML/XSLT IDE, invoke Saxon with
            the shell stylesheet to apply it to a Journal Publishing 3.0 file or to a subdirectory
            of such files. If a DTD is referenced by the file, make sure it is available. Place the
            results in the location of your choice. Copy the <monospace>jpub-preview.css</monospace>
            file next to the HTML results. You are done.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>XSL-FO preview pipeline</title>
          <p>Two alternatives are available:</p>
          <list>
            <list-item>
              <p>Configure your XSL-FO engine to run a transformation using a recent version of
                Saxon (the stylesheets have been tested with version 9), and invoke the
                transformation from the formatter.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Run the transformation in the same way as when producing HTML, to generate an XML
                XSL-FO file that can be processed by the XSL-FO formatting engine.</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>The tradeoff is that while the first method requires a (one-time) configuration, it is
            easier for the user. It is a common feature of XSL-FO engines to allow configuring them
            to use the XSLT transformation engine of your choice.<fn>
              <p>The Journal Publishing 3.0 XSL-FO preview stylesheet was tested with the
                AntennaHouse XSL formatter, version 4.3. Instructions for configuring AntennaHouse
                to use an alternative XSLT processor can be found in their user documentation; the
                settings to change are under the <bold>Format / Format Option Setting</bold> menu
                option. A tip: test your invocation of Saxon from the command line first, so you can
                paste accurate settings into the dialog box.</p>
            </fn></p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Extending or writing your own Saxon shell stylesheet</title>
        <p>The shell stylesheets included in this package all have the same logic. Stylesheets to be
          called in and applied to the source data, in sequence, are named in a variable in the
          stylesheet. Inserting or removing components is as easy as changing this variable.</p>
        <p>For example, the stylesheet <monospace>jpub3-PMCcit-xhtml.xsl</monospace> has the
          variable <monospace>$processes</monospace> declared as
          follows:<preformat position="anchor">&lt;xsl:variable name="processes">
  &lt;step>citations-prep/jpub3-PMCcit.xsl&lt;/step>
  &lt;step>preview/jpub3-html-preview.xsl&lt;/step>
  &lt;step>post/xhtml-ns.xsl&lt;/step>
&lt;/xsl:variable></preformat>Add
          a step to this
          declaration:<preformat position="anchor">&lt;xsl:variable name="processes">
  <bold>&lt;step>prep/jpub3-webfilter.xsl&lt;/step></bold>
  &lt;step>citations-prep/jpub3-PMCcit.xsl&lt;/step>
  &lt;step>main/jpub3-html-preview.xsl&lt;/step>
  &lt;step>post/xhtml-ns.xsl&lt;/step>
&lt;/xsl:variable></preformat>Now,
          an additional preprocess <monospace>prep/jpub3-webfilter.xsl</monospace> is run before the
          citation preprocessing step.</p>
        <p>Of course, we recommend copying a shell with a new name and making changes there, in
          order to preserve the integrity of files in the distribution.</p>
        <p>All paths given are relative to the shell stylesheet at the top level of this
          distribution.</p>
        <p>Note that configuration of the output serialization using the
            <monospace>xsl:output</monospace> instruction is designated by the shell stylesheet.
          Accordingly, a shell stylesheet intended to generate plain HTML might have
            <monospace>method="html"</monospace> indicated in its <monospace>xsl:output</monospace>,
          while a shell stylesheet generating XHTML should have
            <monospace>method="xhtml"</monospace>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Designing and running your own pipeline</title>
        <p>The shell stylesheets are provided for convenience, but they do introduce a dependency on
          the Saxon XSLT processor. You can remove this dependency by implementing a pipeline in the
          framework of your choice, including shell scripts or batch files, scripting languages,
          build tools such as Unix <monospace>make</monospace> or Apache Ant, or full-blown pipeline
          processors possibly including XProc implementations.<fn>
            <p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc</ext-link> is the W3C
              pipelining language standard, not finalized at the time of writing.</p>
          </fn></p>
        <p>The principle is simple: each step in the pipeline generates results that are taken as
          the input for the next step in the pipeline. Serialization may follow each step (if each
          pipeline reads its input from the file system) or may be performed only after the last
          step (if steps are connected using event streams or if intermediate results are held in
          memory).</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that an XSLT engine will still be required to run the separate steps, and
          that several of the stylesheets provided do require an XSLT 2.0 processor.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Running without a pipeline</title>
        <p>Running a single preview stylesheet standalone is not recommended since no support for
          formatting of citation elements is provided outside the preprocessors designed for that
          purpose. Nevertheless, if bibliographic citations are not an issue, either the HTML or the
          XSL-FO preview transformation can be run in an XSLT 1.0 processor, including client-side
          (in a web browser or other XSLT-capable display engine).</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Tweaks and extensions to the main Preview stylesheets</title>
      <p>These stylesheets provide for basic formatting of Journal Publishing data for preview; they
        are not designed to serve as production stylesheets. Their functionality can be extended or
        modified, however. It is recommended that modifications make use of the XSLT import
        mechanism: write your modified templates in a separate stylesheet module that imports the
        main stylesheet module. The modifications can then be maintained seperately in one
        place.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>CSS stylesheet</title>
        <p>HTML results are generated with a link to <monospace>jpub-preview.css</monospace>, given
          as a relative path that expects the named file to be in the same subdirectory as the HTML
          result file (or the XML source file if it is processed directly in a browser).</p>
        <p>This can be altered at runtime by overriding the value of the <monospace>css</monospace>
          parameter supplied to the main HTML Preview stylesheet. This allows a CSS stylesheet with
          another name to be used or a stylesheet to be located elsewhere. If an empty string is
          provided, the HTML results will have no link to an external CSS.</p>
        <p>Of course, altering <monospace>jpub-preview.css</monospace> or providing your own CSS
          stylesheet is an easy way to alter the look and feel of output without editing any XSLT.
          Many of the basic settings in the HTML presentation, including fonts, rules, colors
          (including the colors of warnings or generated text) may be customized in this way.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Enabling autonumbering in the XSLT</title>
        <p>As described in the User's Guide, the Preview stylesheet does not generate labels with
          automatic numbering for elements in presentation, except the <monospace>fn</monospace> and
            <monospace>ref</monospace> elements as described there. However, the stylesheets are
          provided with templates that can be modified in order to provide automated numbering. See
          the templates in mode "label-text" in the stylesheets.</p>

      <title>Specification of "simple citation" Journal Publishing 3.0</title>
      <p>Projects that wish to dispense with automated formatting of citations, to extend the
        automated processing provided, or to develop their own citation formatting logic, will need
        to know the subset of Journal Publishing 3.0 that can be reliably converted by the preview
        stylesheets. This profile introduces additional constraints on elements related to
        bibliographic citations: <monospace>element-citation</monospace>,
          <monospace>nlm-citation</monospace>, <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace> and their
        children, along with the related elements <monospace>product</monospace>,
          <monospace>related-article</monospace> and <monospace>related-object</monospace>.</p>
      <list>
        <list-item>
          <p><monospace>element-citation</monospace> and <monospace>nlm-citation</monospace> are not
            recognized as such. A preprocessor should convert them into
              <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace>, providing their contents with punctuation in
            the process. (This is what the packaged citation preprocessors do.) If these elements
            appear, preview stylesheets will present them without formatting.</p>

          <p>These elements are permitted in citation elements in Journal Publishing 3.0, but are

            strip them from content or convert them into presentation-oriented elements (listed
            above), with appropriate punctuation, according to the rules of the chosen citation
            format. If they appear, these element can be expected to be processed by a preview
            stylesheet according to default rules, which generally means their content will appear
