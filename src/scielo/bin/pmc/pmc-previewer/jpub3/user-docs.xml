      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>These stylesheets format documents encoded in XML using version 3.0 of the NLM/NCBI Journal
        Publishing tag set. Previews in both HTML and PDF format (via XSL-FO) are supported. Most
        generic Journal Publishing structures are supported, with assumptions and limitations as
        described here.</p>
      <p>This documentation, including this User Guide, the Quick Start Guide, and Technical
        documentation, are all included in this package encoded in NLM/NCBI Journal Publishing XML,
        with HTML and PDF presentation versions generated using the Preview stylesheets.</p>
      <p>Assuming the user already has valid Journal Publishing 3.0 data, the most important
        consideration regarding application of these stylesheets regards the bibliographic citation
        format desired. This distribution provides for semi-automated formatting of citations in two
        formats: NLM/Pubmed, and APA. Users who have a requirement to display citations in another
        format, or who do not need any citation processing, should refer to the <xref
          rid="citations">Citations</xref> section below.</p>
      <p>For a more precise description of the technical dependencies of these stylesheets, along
        with documentation of alternative ways to deploy and apply them and how to extend and modify
        them, users should consult the Technical documentation.</p>

      <title>Getting started</title>
      <p>To select which stylesheet to use, you will first need to determine the following:<list
          list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Do you want HTML/CSS, or PDF?</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Are your citations in NLM/Pubmed format? APA format? (These are the only formats
              supported by these stylesheets.)</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>To make HTML:</p>
            <list>
              <list-item>
                <p>If your citations use NLM/Pubmed style, you will use
                    <monospace>jpub3-PMCcit-html.xsl</monospace></p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p>If your citations use APA style, you will use
                    <monospace>jpub3-APAcit-html.xsl</monospace></p>
              </list-item>
            </list>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>To make PDF:</p>
            <list>
              <list-item>
                <p>If your citations use NLM/Pubmed style, you will use
                    <monospace>jpub3-PMCcit-xslfo.xsl</monospace></p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p>If your citations use APA style, you will use
                    <monospace>jpub3-APAcit-xslfo.xsl</monospace></p>
              </list-item>
            </list>
          </list-item>
        </list>Then:<list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Apply the stylesheet to a valid Journal Publishing 3.0 document, or a subdirectory of
              such documents, using a recent version of Saxon (a freely available XSLT 2.0
                processor).<fn id="saxon-versions">
                <p>The stylesheets were developed and tested with Saxon 9.1.0.3 and Saxon 9.1.0.5.
                  The extension function the shell stylesheets rely on is available in versions of
                  Saxon back to 8.9.</p>
              </fn></p>
            <p>When you run the stylesheet, messages will be echoed to your console reporting on
              progress. Do not be concerned by warning messages stating that you are running an XSLT
              1.0 stylesheet with a 2.0 processor, since that is what you are doing. These
              stylesheets will run in XSLT "backward compatibility mode", and have been designed to
              work properly with either 1.0 or 2.0 processors.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>When the result format is HTML, copy <monospace>jpub-preview.css</monospace> to the
              file system next to the result file(s).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>When the result format is XSL-FO, run the result file in an XSL-FO formatter,
              according to its instructions.</p>
            <p>(Many XSL-FO formatters allow running an XSLT transformation directly to apply a
              stylesheet to a document. If you wish to do this and you are using one of the shell
              stylesheets provided, see to it that your formatter invokes Saxon as its XSLT
              component.)</p>

        <p>Saxon is a Java application and requires Java to be installed. Java 1.4 is required; at
          least Java 1.5 is preferred. Saxon 9 is also available within a number of different
          toolkits and XML editing environments, which provide their own user interfaces to the
          tool. If SaxonSA is used, the command line will be different. See the Saxon documentation

    <sec>
      <title>Advanced options</title>
      <p>In addition to the straightforward application of formatting to Journal Publishing content
        using either of the supported bibliographic citation styles, this suite of stylesheets
        supports a number of advanced options. Some of these work directly; others are included as
        demonstrations of how processes may be customized to meet local requirements.</p>
      <p>In order to learn more, see the section on <xref rid="special-purpose">Special-purpose
          stylesheets</xref> below, along with the Technical documentation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="citations-sec">
      <title>Assumptions made by the preview processing</title>
      <p>These stylesheets are designed to handle a broad range of inputs, generally requiring only
        that input data be XML valid to the NLM/NCBI Journal Publishing 3.0 DTD. Inevitably,
        however, there are limitations in their handling of structures that are valid but unlikely
        and/or poorly controlled by a schema, and of variant patterns of tagging.</p>
      <p>Caution: while these stylesheets do their best to handle "normal" input, they should not be
        taken as an indicator of a norm. "Variant" does not necessarily mean "incorrect", and where
        local practice has evolved to meet particular local processing requirements, these
        stylesheets may and should be altered or extended to accommodate them.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Known limitations of these stylesheets</title>
        <sec>
          <title>Running page headers</title>
          <p>The PDF Preview stylesheet generates running headers using the main article title
              (<monospace>article-title</monospace> inside
              <monospace>article-meta/title-group</monospace>). If the main article title is too
            long, an alternative title can be provided for the page header; if available, an
              <monospace>alt-title</monospace> with <monospace>alt-title-type</monospace> of
            'running-head' will be used.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Super- and subscripting limitations</title>
          <p>On <monospace>sub</monospace> and <monospace>sup</monospace> elements the
              <monospace>arrange</monospace> attribute is not supported in either preview. All
            instances will be treated as <monospace>arrange='stagger'</monospace>.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Addresses</title>
          <p>The document model allows addresses (the <monospace>address</monospace> element) both
            as structured elements, and within inline content such as paragraphs.</p>
          <p>The preview stylesheets assume that addresses are formatted as blocks broken into
            separate lines, one for each element in the address, <italic>unless</italic> the address
            contains no <monospace>address-line</monospace> elements <italic>and</italic> it appears
            in paragraph content (that is, directly within <monospace>p</monospace>,
              <monospace>license-p</monospace>, <monospace>collab</monospace>,
              <monospace>named-content</monospace> and <monospace>styled-content</monospace>
            elements).</p>
          <p>Address elements inside <monospace>aff</monospace> (affiliation) are always formatted
            in line.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Sub-articles</title>
          <p>The HTML preview stylesheet includes code for handling sub-articles, including the
            elements <monospace>sub-article</monospace> and <monospace>response</monospace>. Because
            the Journal Publishing tag set allows a wide range of ways to deploy and manage such
            content, particularly with respect to metadata and ancillary materials such as
            references and footnotes, these features have not been fully tested. If you have
              <monospace>sub-article</monospace> or <monospace>response</monospace> content,
            extending one or both stylesheets in view of your particular tagging patterns and
            requirements will probably be necessary.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Section metadata</title>
          <p>The same thing is true of section-level metadata (<monospace>sec-meta</monospace>),
            particularly with respect to the <monospace>contrib-group</monospace> element inside
              <monospace>sec-meta</monospace>. </p>
          <p>Also, within <monospace>sec-meta</monospace> in the PDF preview, only simple keywords
              (<monospace>kwd</monospace>) within <monospace>kwd-group</monospace> will be rendered;
              <monospace>compound-kwd</monospace> is ignored by these stylesheets.</p>
          <p>Test the stylesheets against your content and be prepared to amend the stylesheets, if
            necessary.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Special characters</title>
          <p>These stylesheets do not support the <monospace>private-char</monospace>,
              <monospace>glyph-data</monospace>, or <monospace>glyph-ref</monospace> elements.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Graphics</title>
          <p>Graphics are not resized in the HTML preview, but displayed at native resolution. In
            the PDF preview, they may be scaled down to fit in available space, but smaller graphics
            that already fit will not be adjusted.</p>
          <p>In the HTML preview, graphics are expected to be located as given in the source data
            relative to the HTML <italic>result</italic> file. So, if source data has a graphic with
              <monospace>xlink:href='snapshots/babypic.jpg'</monospace>, the result file will link
            to 'snapshots/babypic.jpg'. If graphic files are maintained relative to the source data,
            they should either be copied to the same location relative to the result, or an absolute
            path to the graphic should be given as the value, or (most simply) the HTML result file
            should be placed next to the XML source file, in order to ensure that graphics will be
            visible in the browser.</p>
          <p>In the PDF preview, a runtime parameter, <monospace>base-dir</monospace>, must be given
            to identify the directory relative to which graphics are located. If the XSL process is
            initiated using one of the provided XSLT 2.0 shell stylesheets, this parameter will be
            provided automatically as the base directory of the source file, so graphics should be
            located relative to the source data. If no parameter is given, either graphics must be
            designated with absolute path names, or they must be located relative to the
              <italic>stylesheet</italic>.</p>
          <p>Alternative text on graphics provided as <monospace>alt-text</monospace> are not
            rendered in the PDF preview.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Styled content and the HTML <monospace>style</monospace> attribute</title>
          <p>The Journal Publishing document model makes provision for styling content directly by
            using CSS styles, either associated with table elements (HTML table elements in this
            model) or as the value given the <monospace>style</monospace> attribute of the
              <monospace>styled-content</monospace> inline element.</p>
          <p>When this appears, the HTML preview stylesheet will simply pass the values through.
            Results will depend on the level of CSS conformance both in the code and in the
            browser.</p>
          <p>In the PDF preview, <monospace>width</monospace> and
              <monospace>vertical-align</monospace> values associated with tables are mapped to
            formatting in the result. On any element with the <monospace>style</monospace>
            attribute, values of the following properties are mapped: <monospace>color</monospace>;
              <monospace>background-color</monospace>; <monospace>font-size</monospace>;
              <monospace>font-weight</monospace>; <monospace>font-style</monospace>;
              <monospace>font-family</monospace>; <monospace>text-decoration</monospace>. Note that
            incorrect CSS values may result in errors when XSL-FO stylesheet results are
            formatted.</p>
          <p>Note in particular that CSS properties related to borders are not supported in the PDF
            preview. For table cell borders, some bordering behavior can be specified using
            attributes on the <monospace>table</monospace> element.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Floating objects and the <monospace>position</monospace> attribute</title>
          <p>Floating behavior actually entails two different functionalities: allowing a formatting
            application to determine (and presumably optimize) the position on the page of objects
            whose position is not to be anchored in the flow of text; and managing objects out of
            line (probably but not necessarily so they can be so placed) by gathering them into a
            group at the end of the document.</p>
          <p>The first feature in Journal Publishing tagging is controlled through the use of
              <monospace>position</monospace> attributes on objects that may be placed in this way
            by the formatter. These elements include <monospace>boxed-text</monospace>,
              <monospace>chem-struct-wrap</monospace>, <monospace>fig</monospace>,
              <monospace>fig-group</monospace>, <monospace>graphic</monospace>,
              <monospace>media</monospace>, <monospace>preformat</monospace>,
              <monospace>supplementary-material</monospace>, <monospace>table-wrap</monospace>,
              <monospace>table-wrap-group</monospace>. The second feature is supported by means of
            the <monospace>floats-group</monospace> element, where such objects may be gathered.</p>
          <p>Note that <monospace>position='float'</monospace> may be assigned to any of these
            objects irrespective of whether it is gathered into <monospace>floats-group</monospace>.
            Similarly, it is possible (although not ordinary) for an object to be placed inside
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace>, and not in the body of the document, without
            assigning it <monospace>position='float'</monospace>.</p>
          <p>In this context, it is especially important to note that by default, on all these
            objects, <monospace>position</monospace> is assigned a value of 'float' by the Journal
            Publishing DTD. If the attribute is not set in the data, the formatting stylesheets
            assume the value should be 'float', both out of respect for the semantics specified by
            the formal document model, and in order to prevent different formatting when the DTD is
            used from when it is not.</p>
          <p>Any object assigned <monospace>position='float'</monospace> will be allowed to float on
            the page. Exceptions to this rule include the following:<list>
              <list-item>
                <p>No object, even one set to float, will float if it appears inside another object
                  set to float. Note again that objects are set to float implicitly, unless position
                  is set to 'anchor' or 'margin'.</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><monospace>graphic</monospace> and <monospace>media</monospace> will not float
                  when they appear inside any of the other elements that may float. (A
                    <monospace>graphic</monospace> inside a <monospace>fig</monospace> will not
                  float, even if its <monospace>position</monospace> is set to float and
                  irrespective of whether the <monospace>fig</monospace> floats.)</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><monospace>fig</monospace> will not float inside <monospace>fig-group</monospace>
                  (though the <monospace>fig-group</monospace> may float).</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><monospace>table-wrap</monospace> will not float inside
                    <monospace>table-wrap-group</monospace> (though the group may float).</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><monospace>preformat</monospace> will not float inside
                  <monospace>bio</monospace>, <monospace>boxed-text</monospace>,
                    <monospace>chem-struct</monospace>, <monospace>chem-struct-wrap</monospace>,
                    <monospace>disp-formula</monospace>, <monospace>disp-quote</monospace>,
                    <monospace>fig</monospace>, <monospace>glossary</monospace>,
                    <monospace>supplementary-material</monospace>,
                    <monospace>disp-formula</monospace>, or <monospace>table-wrap</monospace>. Note,
                  however, that like other floatable objects, <monospace>preformat</monospace> will
                  ordinarily float unless its position says not to!</p>
              </list-item>
            </list></p>
          <p>Also, the value 'margin' is not supported; objects with
              <monospace>position='margin'</monospace> will act as if they have
              <monospace>position='anchor'</monospace>.</p>
          <p>In the HTML preview, floating an object will not move it on the page; it will only
            allow text to flow around it.</p>
          <p>In the PDF preview, objects with <monospace>position</monospace> = 'float' will be
            positioned on the page by the formatting engine, typically at the top of the same page
            where the object would appear if its <monospace>position</monospace> were 'anchor'. The
            exact placement will depend on the formatting engine.</p>
          <p>Where floating is not wanted, the easiest solution is to set
              <monospace>position</monospace> to 'anchor' on the element.</p>

          <title>Gathering objects in <monospace>floats-group</monospace></title>
          <p>Just like objects elsewhere, the placement of objects tagged inside
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace> is determined by their
              <monospace>position</monospace> attribute. The difference is that when assigned
              <monospace>position='float'</monospace> (and remember this is the value by default),
            in the PDF preview the object is formatted near its first cross-reference. Otherwise,
            and when no such cross-reference appears in the document, it is formatted at the end of
            the document.</p>
          <p>The HTML preview stylesheet displays all objects inside
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace> at the end of the document. (In this case,
            however, cross-references are also hyperlinked.)</p>
          <p>When articles should be formatted with a "Figures" or "Tables" section at the end, an
              <monospace>app</monospace> or <monospace>sec</monospace> should be used for this
            purpose, and the objects anchored in place. The preview stylesheets assume that
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace> is specifically for collecting objects that are
            intended to be formatted elsewhere.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Correct numbering of floating objects</title>
          <p>As described below, the preview stylesheets do not provide automated numbering for
            floating objects (distinguished, as a class, from footnotes, which may also "float"). In
            systems where the stylesheet is extended to provide autonumbering, rules will need to be
            formulated and followed to govern where floating objects are encoded, whether and where
            they are cross-referenced, and the relation between settings of
              <monospace>position</monospace> and appearance (and order) inside
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace>, with appropriate enforcement of these
            constraints. Otherwise it can be expected that their numbers will not always be properly
            sequenced.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Setting <monospace>orientation</monospace></title>
          <p>A number of objects also have an <monospace>orientation</monospace> attribute, which is
            intended to allow specifying that they should be rotated in display, by setting its
            value to 'landscape'.</p>
          <p>The HTML preview stylesheet does not support orientation. The PDF stylesheet does
            rotate the object; however, it assigns (somewhat arbitrarily) a width (i.e., a
              <italic>vertical</italic> spacing for an object formatted in landscape) of 6 inches
            for tables and 4 inches for other objects. While this will almost never be optimal, it
            is the best that can be accomplished without particular formatting specifications for
            each object, and it is enough to show that the orientation is set. Users may wish to
            adjust the stylesheet to meet local needs for positioning and sizing tables and
            figures.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Sizing tables</title>
          <p>In HTML, tables are sized dynamically or according to attributes given on the table
            element.</p>
          <p>In the PDF Preview, by default, tables are formatted at column width. If the
              <monospace>width</monospace> attribute on a table is set to "100%" and
              <monospace>orientation</monospace> is "portrait" (the default), the entire
              <monospace>table-group</monospace> it appears in will be formatted at page width.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Footnotes</title>
          <p>The Journal Publishing model supports either of two general approaches to encoding
            footnotes in valid data. The <monospace>fn</monospace> element may be used in line where
            a reference to a footnote (generally the first or only reference) should appear, with
            the footnote content moved in rendition (typically to the bottom of the page). Or
            footnotes are encoded together in a structured grouping, the
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace> element, and footnote references in the text are
            encoded with <monospace>xref</monospace> elements, like any other cross-reference. The
            latter style of encoding is said in the Journal Publishing documentation to be
            appropriate for "end notes" as opposed to footnotes <italic>per se</italic>.
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace> is permitted in a number of places, including within
            the article back matter and in several other locations where footnotes are commonly
            grouped in journal articles.</p>
          <p>These stylesheets will support either approach to encoding footnotes. In the HTML
            preview output, all footnotes encoded inline are grouped together in a section called
            "Notes" appearing at the end of the document. In the PDF, footnotes encoded inline are
            formatted at the foot of the page. In both cases, footnotes grouped in
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace> or in <monospace>author-notes</monospace> appear
            collected together where the <monospace>fn-group</monospace> or
              <monospace>author-notes</monospace> appears. This will usually be inside the back
            matter, but it can also occur in other places such as in the front matter,
              <monospace>boxed-text</monospace> or <monospace>table-wrap-foot</monospace>.</p>
          <p>Note that the two approaches (loose <monospace>fn</monospace> elements and
              <monospace>fn</monospace> within <monospace>fn-group</monospace>) may be combined, but
            this is inadvisable unless footnotes are numbered in the data, since it may result in
            two distinct sets of footnote numbering. It is best to encode footnotes all one way or
            all the other. Generally, if you use <monospace>fn</monospace> elements within mixed
            content, do not also use <monospace>fn-group</monospace>. If you use
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace>, use it for all footnotes and use
              <monospace>xref</monospace> to provide references to them.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in the PDF preview, errors will result if inline footnotes appear inside
            floating objects (such as boxed text or figures). This is because the XSL-FO formatter
            cannot position both a footnote and a floating object together (since when a footnote is
            moved to appear on the same page as a float, the page layout determining where the float
            can be placed may also be thrown off). This restriction means, in effect, that if you
            have footnotes in your floating objects, you must locate the footnotes inside an
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace>, and reference them with <monospace>xref</monospace>,
            rather than using <monospace>fn</monospace> elements inline.</p>
          <p>With regard to their numbering, footnotes are described further below.</p>

        <title>Autonumbering, labels, and cross-references</title>
        <p>Except for two element types, <monospace>ref</monospace> (reference) and
            <monospace>fn</monospace> (footnote), these preview stylesheets do not generate numbered
          labels automatically. If figures, tables and similar structures such as statements,
          supplementary material, etc. are to be labelled, they must be labelled in the data. Labels
          provided in the data (<monospace>label</monospace> elements) are displayed with the
          elements they label; the same label content also appears in cross-references that point to
          those elements when a cross-reference element (<monospace>xref</monospace> elements) is
          given as empty. (When <monospace>xref</monospace> elements have text content, it is used
          as the text of the cross-reference, irrespective of whether a label appears with its
          target.)</p>
        <p>The approach to labelling taken by these stylesheets is meant to be as transparent and
          easy to understand as possible: it assumes that when labels are wanted on content, they
          will be provided explicitly in the source data (and therefore should not be generated
          automatically), and that when a cross-reference is made to an object, it will either have
          content of its own (which can serve as anchoring text), or its target will have an
          explicit label that can be used unaltered as the text in the cross-reference.<fn>
            <p>For projects that wish to exploit the potentials of automated processes for
              systematic numbering, the stylesheet does contain code that can be configured to
              generate labels, including autonumbering. See the Technical documentation for more
              information.</p>
          </fn></p>
        <p>There are two exceptions to this principle: numbering is be provided for footnotes
            (<monospace>fn</monospace> elements) and for references (<monospace>ref</monospace>
          elements) when they do not have explicit labels, as these elements' primary purpose is
          their systematic cross-referencing. In both cases, explicit labels
            (<monospace>label</monospace> elements or, in the case of footnotes,
            <monospace>symbol</monospace> attributes) will override autogenerated labels, allowing
          for projects to control these values in their data when necessary. In order to protect the
          consistency of labeling, warning messages may be generated for unlabelled elements where
          labels were expected. In certain places, such as within the document metadata
            (<monospace>author-notes</monospace> or <monospace>fn-group</monospace> inside
            <monospace>title-group</monospace>), unlabelled footnotes are permitted in the PDF
          preview, and will not generate warning labels even if other footnotes have labels.</p>
        <p>Automated numbers are assigned based on the order of footnotes in the document, not of
          first references to them. Similarly, in the PDF output, since footnotes are placed based
          on the location of the <monospace>fn</monospace> element in the document, a
          cross-reference can be made to a footnote that will appear on a subsequent page. This also
          means that if footnote A appears before footnote B in the document, a reference to
          footnote B will appear out of sequence if it appears before footnote A does. The easiest
          ways to avoid this are (a) to use footnotes as endnotes (group them in
            <monospace>fn-group</monospace> in the back matter), or (b) make sure that if inline
          footnotes are used (resulting in actual footnotes in the PDF), they are not placed before
          cross-references to the same footnote.</p>
        <p>These stylesheets do not accommodate a practice of redundant tagging, whereby a footnote
          encoded inline is also provided with an <monospace>xref</monospace> (cross-reference)
          element to that footnote. If an <monospace>fn</monospace> element is used in line, a
          reference will appear for it. Cross-references to footnotes should be used only for end
          notes (<monospace>fn</monospace> elements in <monospace>fn-group</monospace>) or in cases
          where more than one reference is made to a single footnote.</p>
        <sec>
          <title>Summary of best practice respecting cross-references and labels</title>
          <p>For correct operation with these stylesheets, the simplest approach to using labels and
            assuring that cross-references are clear is to follow an "all or nothing" rule:<list>
              <list-item>
                <p>As described above, either all footnotes (<monospace>fn</monospace> elements)
                  should be enclosed in <monospace>fn-group</monospace> elements (effectively, to
                  present as endnotes), or all should be placed inline at their point of first
                  reference.</p>
                <p>Avoid using (empty) <monospace>xref</monospace> elements to refer to footnotes
                  that have not yet appeared, unless the footnote is inside
                    <monospace>fn-group</monospace>, as this will result in numbering out of
                  sequence. Footnote numbers are assigned in the order of the footnotes, not of
                  first reference to them. (This will not matter if footnotes are labelled in the
                  source data or if <monospace>xref</monospace> elements have data content, in which
                  case maintaining correct referencing is an editorial task.)</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p>Either label all footnotes explicitly in the source data (using
                    <monospace>label</monospace> elements or <monospace>symbol</monospace>
                  attributes), or let the system number all of them.</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p>Similarly, no reference elements (<monospace>ref</monospace>), whether they are
                  cross-referenced or not, should be given <monospace>label</monospace> elements, or
                  all of them should.</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p>Any object type (such as figures or tables) that is cross-referenced should be
                  given <monospace>label</monospace> elements consistently and throughout,
                    <italic>or</italic> cross-references (<monospace>xref</monospace> elements)
                  should never be empty.</p>
              </list-item>
            </list></p>
          <p>As described in the Technical documentation, any of the stylesheet logic regarding
            generating labels and/or automatic numbering can be modified in the stylesheets.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Warning messages for missing labels</title>
          <p>While (apart from the complications of footnotes and references) this logic is fairly
            simple, an error condition may still arise if an object has no
              <monospace>label</monospace> element, and a cross-reference
              (<monospace>xref</monospace>) pointing to it has no content of its own. That is, while
            either its own content or its target's label can provide text for a cross-reference, a
            particular cross-reference might have neither (even in a valid document). When this
            happens, a warning message will be generated in place of a label, both with the object
            and wherever it is cross-referenced. A summary view of all such warning messages is also
            provided in a special section entitled <bold>Process Warnings</bold> at the end of the
            document.</p>
          <p>This error is corrected either by providing the targeted object with a
              <monospace>label</monospace> element (or alternatively, for a footnote, a
              <monospace>symbol</monospace> attribute), by providing its cross-reference(s) with
            content, or both.</p>
          <p>When there are no such errors, the <bold>Process Warnings</bold> section does not
            appear.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Other limitations on <monospace>xref</monospace> elements</title>
          <p>The current implementation of the preview stylesheets does not support cross-references
            to more than one target using a single <monospace>xref</monospace> element. Although
            according to the DTD, an <monospace>IDREFS</monospace> value is allowed on
              <monospace>xref/@rid</monospace>, only a single <monospace>IDREF</monospace> will
            work.</p>
          <p>In other
            words,<preformat position="anchor">&lt;xref rid="fig1">See Figure 1&lt;/xref></preformat>will
            generate a cross-reference in the output,
            but<preformat position="anchor">&lt;xref rid="fig1 fig2">See Figures 1 and 2&lt;/xref></preformat>will
            not work correctly (it will attempt to link to an object identified as "fig1 fig2").</p>

            <p>The main Preview stylesheets (found in the <monospace>main</monospace>
              subdirectory);</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Various ancillary stylesheets for pre- or post-processing data in support of special
              operations (in the <monospace>prep</monospace>, <monospace>citations-prep</monospace>
              and <monospace>post</monospace> subdirectories);</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>"Shell" or "wrapper" stylesheets (here called "top-level stylesheets") to be used to
              invoke the others in combination. These are the stylesheets that will typically be
              applied directly to documents, as described above.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>Users wanting a simple approach can acquire a recent version of the Saxon XSLT
        engine, identify the top-level stylesheet that performs the necessary tasks, and apply it to
        their data.<xref rid="saxon-versions"/></p>
      <p>The top-level stylesheets depend on the Saxon processor because they use XSLT 2.0 features
        and Saxon extension functions to perform "pipelining", efficiently executing a sequence of
        transformations without writing interim results to the file system. All of the stylesheets
        can also be run on their own, and some of them work also in XSLT 1.0 engines. Due to
        limitations of the main Preview stylesheets, especially limitations in their handling of
        citations (which cannot be handled generically), this is recommended only in special cases
        within controlled environments where citation formatting is otherwise accounted for.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, publishers and content creators are free to experiment. This model also
        serves to provide for extensions, in the form either of new processing steps (such as a
        preprocessor for a new citation format) or modifications to existing steps. Or projects may
        wish to "unbundle" the processes and apply the stylesheets by different means altogether.
        The Technical documentation describes these alternatives in more detail.</p>
      <p>Top-level stylesheets included in this package are as follows:<def-list>

            <def>
              <p>Generates XSL-FO results for PDF production, with formatting of NLM/Pubmed

              <monospace>jpub3-APAcit-xslfo.xsl</monospace>
            </term>
            <def>
              <p>GeneratesXSL-FO results for PDF production, with formatting of APA citations
                supported.</p>
            </def>
          </def-item>
          <def-item>
            <term>
              <monospace>jpub3-PMCcit-web-html.xsl</monospace>
            </term>
            <def>
              <p>This works like <monospace>jpub3-PMCcit-html.xsl</monospace> except it includes a
                preprocess that removes all elements marked with a
                  <monospace>specific-use</monospace> attribute whose value is "print-only". This
                stylesheet works by invoking an additional preprocessing step,
                  <monospace>prep/jpub3-webfilter.xsl</monospace>. It may be useful mainly as a
                demonstration, illustrating how processes can be customized to meet local
                requirements as described in the Technical documentation.</p>

              <monospace>jpub3-PMCcit-xhtml.xsl</monospace>
            </term>
            <def>
              <p>This also works like <monospace>jpub3-PMCcit-html.xsl</monospace>, except it
                includes a postprocess that converts the HTML results into XHTML, resulting in XHTML
                results that can be correctly rendered by MathML-capable browsers. The postprocessor
                called by this stylesheet, <monospace>xhtml-ns.xsl</monospace>, can be applied as
                the final step in any pipeline that must generate XHTML, as also described in the
                Technical docs.</p>

            <def>
              <p>This shell is the complement of <monospace>jpub3-PMCcit-web-html.xsl</monospace>.
                It formats citations in NLM/Pubmed citation format, removes all elements marked with
                a <monospace>specific-use</monospace> attribute whose value is "web-only", and then
                transforms the document to XSL-FO results, ready for formatting as PDF by an XSL
                formatter.</p>
