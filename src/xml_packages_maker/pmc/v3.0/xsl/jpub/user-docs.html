        that input data be XML valid to the NLM/NCBI Journal Publishing 3.0 DTD. Inevitably,
        however, there are limitations in their handling of structures that are valid but unlikely
        and/or poorly controlled by a schema, and of variant patterns of tagging.</p><p id="d10e137">Caution: while these stylesheets do their best to handle "normal" input, they should not be
        taken as an indicator of a norm. "Variant" does not necessarily mean "incorrect", and where

            the Journal Publishing tag set allows a wide range of ways to deploy and manage such
            content, particularly with respect to metadata and ancillary materials such as
            references and footnotes, these features have not been fully tested. If you have
              <tt>sub-article</tt> or <tt>response</tt> content,
            extending one or both stylesheets in view of your particular tagging patterns and

            the PDF preview, they may be scaled down to fit in available space, but smaller graphics
            that already fit will not be adjusted.</p><p id="d10e282">In the HTML preview, graphics are expected to be located as given in the source data
            relative to the HTML <i>result</i> file. So, if source data has a graphic with
              <tt>xlink:href='snapshots/babypic.jpg'</tt>, the result file will link
            to 'snapshots/babypic.jpg'. If graphic files are maintained relative to the source data,
            they should either be copied to the same location relative to the result, or an absolute
            path to the graphic should be given as the value, or (most simply) the HTML result file
            should be placed next to the XML source file, in order to ensure that graphics will be
            visible in the browser.</p><p id="d10e290">In the PDF preview, a runtime parameter, <tt>base-dir</tt>, must be given
            to identify the directory relative to which graphics are located. If the XSL process is
            initiated using one of the provided XSLT 2.0 shell stylesheets, this parameter will be
            provided automatically as the base directory of the source file, so graphics should be
            located relative to the source data. If no parameter is given, either graphics must be
            designated with absolute path names, or they must be located relative to the
              <i>stylesheet</i>.</p><p id="d10e298">Alternative text on graphics provided as <tt>alt-text</tt> are not

            using CSS styles, either associated with table elements (HTML table elements in this
            model) or as the value given the <tt>style</tt> attribute of the
              <tt>styled-content</tt> inline element.</p><p id="d10e317">When this appears, the HTML preview stylesheet will simply pass the values through.
            Results will depend on the level of CSS conformance both in the code and in the
            browser.</p><p id="d10e319">In the PDF preview, <tt>width</tt> and
              <tt>vertical-align</tt> values associated with tables are mapped to
            formatting in the result. On any element with the <tt>style</tt>
            attribute, values of the following properties are mapped: <tt>color</tt>;
              <tt>background-color</tt>; <tt>font-size</tt>;
              <tt>font-weight</tt>; <tt>font-style</tt>;
              <tt>font-family</tt>; <tt>text-decoration</tt>. Note that
            incorrect CSS values may result in errors when XSL-FO stylesheet results are
            formatted.</p><p id="d10e352">Note in particular that CSS properties related to borders are not supported in the PDF
            preview. For table cell borders, some bordering behavior can be specified using
            attributes on the <tt>table</tt> element.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="d10e357"><!-- named anchor --></a><h4 class="subsection-title">Floating objects and the <tt>position</tt> attribute</h4><p id="d10e363">Floating behavior actually entails two different functionalities: allowing a formatting
            application to determine (and presumably optimize) the position on the page of objects
            whose position is not to be anchored in the flow of text; and managing objects out of
            line (probably but not necessarily so they can be so placed) by gathering them into a
            group at the end of the document.</p><p id="d10e365">The first feature in Journal Publishing tagging is controlled through the use of
              <tt>position</tt> attributes on objects that may be placed in this way
            by the formatter. These elements include <tt>boxed-text</tt>,
              <tt>chem-struct-wrap</tt>, <tt>fig</tt>,
              <tt>fig-group</tt>, <tt>graphic</tt>,
              <tt>media</tt>, <tt>preformat</tt>,
              <tt>supplementary-material</tt>, <tt>table-wrap</tt>,
              <tt>table-wrap-group</tt>. The second feature is supported by means of
            the <tt>floats-group</tt> element, where such objects may be gathered.</p><p id="d10e405">Note that <tt>position='float'</tt> may be assigned to any of these
            objects irrespective of whether it is gathered into <tt>floats-group</tt>.
            Similarly, it is possible (although not ordinary) for an object to be placed inside
              <tt>floats-group</tt>, and not in the body of the document, without
            assigning it <tt>position='float'</tt>.</p><p id="d10e419">In this context, it is especially important to note that by default, on all these
            objects, <tt>position</tt> is assigned a value of 'float' by the Journal
            Publishing DTD. If the attribute is not set in the data, the formatting stylesheets
            assume the value should be 'float', both out of respect for the semantics specified by
            the formal document model, and in order to prevent different formatting when the DTD is
            used from when it is not.</p><p id="d10e424">Any object assigned <tt>position='float'</tt> will be allowed to float on
            the page. Exceptions to this rule include the following:<div class="list"><a name="d10e429"><!-- named anchor --></a><ul><li><p id="d10e431">No object, even one set to float, will float if it appears inside another object
                  set to float. Note again that objects are set to float implicitly, unless position
                  is set to 'anchor' or 'margin'.</p></li><li><p id="d10e434"><tt>graphic</tt> and <tt>media</tt> will not float
                  when they appear inside any of the other elements that may float. (A
                    <tt>graphic</tt> inside a <tt>fig</tt> will not
                  float, even if its <tt>position</tt> is set to float and
                  irrespective of whether the <tt>fig</tt> floats.)</p></li><li><p id="d10e454"><tt>fig</tt> will not float inside <tt>fig-group</tt>
                  (though the <tt>fig-group</tt> may float).</p></li><li><p id="d10e465"><tt>table-wrap</tt> will not float inside
                    <tt>table-wrap-group</tt> (though the group may float).</p></li><li><p id="d10e473"><tt>preformat</tt> will not float inside
                  <tt>bio</tt>, <tt>boxed-text</tt>,

                    <tt>disp-formula</tt>, or <tt>table-wrap</tt>. Note,
                  however, that like other floatable objects, <tt>preformat</tt> will
                  ordinarily float unless its position says not to!</p></li></ul></div></p><p id="d10e515">Also, the value 'margin' is not supported; objects with
              <tt>position='margin'</tt> will act as if they have
              <tt>position='anchor'</tt>.</p><p id="d10e523">In the HTML preview, floating an object will not move it on the page; it will only
            allow text to flow around it.</p><p id="d10e525">In the PDF preview, objects with <tt>position</tt> = 'float' will be
            positioned on the page by the formatting engine, typically at the top of the same page
            where the object would appear if its <tt>position</tt> were 'anchor'. The
            exact placement will depend on the formatting engine.</p><p id="d10e533">Where floating is not wanted, the easiest solution is to set
              <tt>position</tt> to 'anchor' on the element.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="d10e538"><!-- named anchor --></a><h4 class="subsection-title">Gathering objects in <tt>floats-group</tt></h4><p id="d10e543">Just like objects elsewhere, the placement of objects tagged inside
              <tt>floats-group</tt> is determined by their
              <tt>position</tt> attribute. The difference is that when assigned
              <tt>position='float'</tt> (and remember this is the value by default),
            in the PDF preview the object is formatted near its first cross-reference. Otherwise,
            and when no such cross-reference appears in the document, it is formatted at the end of
            the document.</p><p id="d10e554">The HTML preview stylesheet displays all objects inside
              <tt>floats-group</tt> at the end of the document. (In this case,
            however, cross-references are also hyperlinked.)</p><p id="d10e559">When articles should be formatted with a "Figures" or "Tables" section at the end, an
              <tt>app</tt> or <tt>sec</tt> should be used for this

            formulated and followed to govern where floating objects are encoded, whether and where
            they are cross-referenced, and the relation between settings of
              <tt>position</tt> and appearance (and order) inside
              <tt>floats-group</tt>, with appropriate enforcement of these

            for tables and 4 inches for other objects. While this will almost never be optimal, it
            is the best that can be accomplished without particular formatting specifications for
            each object, and it is enough to show that the orientation is set. Users may wish to

            footnotes in valid data. The <tt>fn</tt> element may be used in line where
            a reference to a footnote (generally the first or only reference) should appear, with
            the footnote content moved in rendition (typically to the bottom of the page). Or
            footnotes are encoded together in a structured grouping, the
              <tt>fn-group</tt> element, and footnote references in the text are
            encoded with <tt>xref</tt> elements, like any other cross-reference. The
            latter style of encoding is said in the Journal Publishing documentation to be
            appropriate for "end notes" as opposed to footnotes <i>per se</i>.
              <tt>fn-group</tt> is permitted in a number of places, including within
            the article back matter and in several other locations where footnotes are commonly
            grouped in journal articles.</p><p id="d10e633">These stylesheets will support either approach to encoding footnotes. In the HTML
            preview output, all footnotes encoded inline are grouped together in a section called
            "Notes" appearing at the end of the document. In the PDF, footnotes encoded inline are
            formatted at the foot of the page. In both cases, footnotes grouped in
              <tt>fn-group</tt> or in <tt>author-notes</tt> appear
            collected together where the <tt>fn-group</tt> or
              <tt>author-notes</tt> appears. This will usually be inside the back
            matter, but it can also occur in other places such as in the front matter,
              <tt>boxed-text</tt> or <tt>table-wrap-foot</tt>.</p><p id="d10e654">Note that the two approaches (loose <tt>fn</tt> elements and
              <tt>fn</tt> within <tt>fn-group</tt>) may be combined, but
            this is inadvisable unless footnotes are numbered in the data, since it may result in
            two distinct sets of footnote numbering. It is best to encode footnotes all one way or
            all the other. Generally, if you use <tt>fn</tt> elements within mixed
            content, do not also use <tt>fn-group</tt>. If you use
              <tt>fn-group</tt>, use it for all footnotes and use
              <tt>xref</tt> to provide references to them.</p><p id="d10e678">Additionally, in the PDF preview, errors will result if inline footnotes appear inside
            floating objects (such as boxed text or figures). This is because the XSL-FO formatter
            cannot position both a footnote and a floating object together (since when a footnote is
            moved to appear on the same page as a float, the page layout determining where the float
            can be placed may also be thrown off). This restriction means, in effect, that if you
            have footnotes in your floating objects, you must locate the footnotes inside an
              <tt>fn-group</tt>, and reference them with <tt>xref</tt>,
            rather than using <tt>fn</tt> elements inline.</p><p id="d10e689">With regard to their numbering, footnotes are described further below.</p></div></div><div class="section"><a name="d10e691"><!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">Autonumbering, labels, and cross-references</h3><p id="d10e694">Except for two element types, <tt>ref</tt> (reference) and
            <tt>fn</tt> (footnote), these preview stylesheets do not generate numbered
          labels automatically. If figures, tables and similar structures such as statements,
          supplementary material, etc. are to be labelled, they must be labelled in the data. Labels
          provided in the data (<tt>label</tt> elements) are displayed with the
          elements they label; the same label content also appears in cross-references that point to
          those elements when a cross-reference element (<tt>xref</tt> elements) is
          given as empty. (When <tt>xref</tt> elements have text content, it is used
          as the text of the cross-reference, irrespective of whether a label appears with its
          target.)</p><p id="d10e711">The approach to labelling taken by these stylesheets is meant to be as transparent and
          easy to understand as possible: it assumes that when labels are wanted on content, they
          will be provided explicitly in the source data (and therefore should not be generated
          automatically), and that when a cross-reference is made to an object, it will either have
          content of its own (which can serve as anchoring text), or its target will have an
          explicit label that can be used unaltered as the text in the cross-reference.<a href="#d10e713"><span class="generated">[2]</span></a></p><p id="d10e716">There are two exceptions to this principle: numbering is be provided for footnotes
            (<tt>fn</tt> elements) and for references (<tt>ref</tt>
          elements) when they do not have explicit labels, as these elements' primary purpose is
          their systematic cross-referencing. In both cases, explicit labels
            (<tt>label</tt> elements or, in the case of footnotes,
            <tt>symbol</tt> attributes) will override autogenerated labels, allowing
          for projects to control these values in their data when necessary. In order to protect the
          consistency of labeling, warning messages may be generated for unlabelled elements where
          labels were expected. In certain places, such as within the document metadata
            (<tt>author-notes</tt> or <tt>fn-group</tt> inside
            <tt>title-group</tt>), unlabelled footnotes are permitted in the PDF
          preview, and will not generate warning labels even if other footnotes have labels.</p><p id="d10e740">Automated numbers are assigned based on the order of footnotes in the document, not of
          first references to them. Similarly, in the PDF output, since footnotes are placed based
          on the location of the <tt>fn</tt> element in the document, a
          cross-reference can be made to a footnote that will appear on a subsequent page. This also
          means that if footnote A appears before footnote B in the document, a reference to
          footnote B will appear out of sequence if it appears before footnote A does. The easiest
          ways to avoid this are (a) to use footnotes as endnotes (group them in
            <tt>fn-group</tt> in the back matter), or (b) make sure that if inline
          footnotes are used (resulting in actual footnotes in the PDF), they are not placed before
          cross-references to the same footnote.</p><p id="d10e748">These stylesheets do not accommodate a practice of redundant tagging, whereby a footnote
          encoded inline is also provided with an <tt>xref</tt> (cross-reference)
          element to that footnote. If an <tt>fn</tt> element is used in line, a
          reference will appear for it. Cross-references to footnotes should be used only for end
          notes (<tt>fn</tt> elements in <tt>fn-group</tt>) or in cases
          where more than one reference is made to a single footnote.</p><div class="section"><a name="d10e762"><!-- named anchor --></a><h4 class="subsection-title">Summary of best practice respecting cross-references and labels</h4><p id="d10e765">For correct operation with these stylesheets, the simplest approach to using labels and

              systematic numbering, the stylesheet does contain code that can be configured to
              generate labels, including autonumbering. See the Technical documentation for more
              information.</p></div><div class="footnote"><a name="d10e886"><!-- named anchor --></a><p id="d10e887"><span class="generated">[3]</span> Note that even in the best of cases, formatting of bibliographic citations according
              to truly generalized and systematic rules is not entirely possible to specify and
              therefore to automate. Testing shows that while these stylesheets will handle the
              majority of common cases properly, adjustments always have to be made. When this
              occurs with the provided stylesheets, users have the same options as if they were
              posed with a format that was not implemented: either extend the stylesheet or fall
              back on explicit formatting using <tt>mixed-citation</tt>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><a name="d10e926"><!-- named anchor --></a><p id="d10e927"><span class="generated">[4]</span> I.e., elements such as <tt>italic</tt> and
