Concepts of the SciELO Methodology
==================================

- `Local server`_
- `SciELO collection or instance`_
- `Types of issues`_
- `Sequential number`_
- `Folders structure`_
- `Programs folder`_
- `Data folder`_

Local server
------------ 

It's a Windows machine where the PC Programs and SciELO website (local site) run.

SciELO collection or instance
-----------------------------

SciELO Collection or instance is a website generated using SciELO Methodology, including the ones which do not use SciELO in their website name. 

Examples of collections or instances: SciELO Brazil, SciELO Chile, SciELO Salud Pública, Rev@Enf, etc.

Types of issues
---------------

regular or supplement
    number formed by articles and texts

ahead
    manuscripts that were approved by editorial board but they are not in a definitive issue. There is an **ahead** number by year.

review/provisional
    number whose purpose is to group accepted articles which are still under review, leaving only their metadata published. There is a **review** number by year. Note: at the site the name adopted is **provisional**

pr (press release)
    number whose purpose is to group the press releases texts of a number or article. There is a **pr** number by issue.

Sequential number
-----------------

The sequential number is a number formed by year (YYYY), followed by a number that gives the issue’s order  within a year. 

This number has two purposes: 

- order of the issue within a year in the "all issues" page of the website
- forming PID. It is strongly recommendable DO NOT MODIFY THIS ITEM if the issue has already been published on the website.

By convention, the sequential number is:

- ahead = 50
- review/provisional = 75
- pr = from 100

Example:

================  =======
v.40 n.1          20091
v.40 n.2          20092
v.40 suppl.       20093
v.40 suppl.2      20094
v.40 n.2 suppl.1  20095
ahead             200950
review            200975
v.40 n.1 pr       2009100
================  =======


Folders Structure
-----------------

SciELO PC Programs  package has the folders:

- bin and xml_scielo, for programs
- serial, for data

You can install them in the same or different folders. BUT by CONVENTION, we recommend C:\\scielo\\bin and c:\\scielo\\serial.

Examples of the same folder:

* c:\\scielo\\bin... and c:\\scielo\\serial
* d:\\scielo_v4.0\\bin and d:\\scielo_v4.0\\serial

Examples of different folders:

* c:\\scielo\\bin... e d:\\scielo\serial
* d:\\scielo-programs\\bin... and d:\\scielo-data\serial

Programs folder
---------------

It contains the programs. E.g.: \\scielo\\bin

Data folder
-----------

e.g.: \\scielo\\serial

In this folder are all data, all the databases.

    - title: it contains data records related to the journal
    - section: it contains data records of sections of the table of contents
    - issue: it contains the records of journal’s issues
    - code: it contains tables of codes/labels
    - PubMed: is used in order to archive the XML files sent to PubMed
    - ISI: is used in order to archive the XML files sent to ISI

    - several `Journal's folder`_:  which contains the issues of the journal

Journal's folder
................

e.g.: \\scielo\\serial\\<acronym>

It contains several folders, each one for each issue of the journal.
    
    .. image:: img/en/dir_serial.jpg

Issue folder
............
  
    .. image:: img/en/dir_serial_abc.jpg



It contains folders like:
    - markup: articles and text files, with markup 
    - body: articles and text files, original, no markup
    - pdf: articles and texts in PDF format
    - img: image files extracted from the PDF files
    - base: the databases generated by `Converter <converter.html>`_ from the files of markup and body folders.



There are rules to name theses folders:
    - Folders for regular  numbers  and supplements: v, followed by the volume number, s, followed by the supplement to volume, n, followed by the number issue, s, followed by the supplement number
        Examples:
            - v31n1 (volume 31, number 1)
            - v31n1s1 (volume 31, number 1, supplement 1)
            - v31n1s0 (volume 31, number 1, supplement)
            - v31s0 (volume 31, supplement)
            - v31s1 (volume 31, supplement 1)
            - v31nspe (volume 31, special number)
            - v31n3a (volume 31, number 3A)
    - Review / Provisional's and ahead's folder: publication’s year, n, followed by the word **review** or **ahead**
        Examples:
            - 2009nahead 
            - 2010nreview
    - Ex-review/provisional's and ex-ahead's folders: ex-, followed by publication’s year, n followed by the number. NOTE: `Converter <converter.html>`_ creates these folders, because it is only way to control data files which were  review/provisional and/or ahead once.
        Examples:
            - ex-2009nahead 
            - ex-2010nreview
    - Press releases' folders: it follows the same rules of regular numbers and supplements, review / provisional and ahead, adding pr at the end of the file name.
        Examples:
            - v31n1pr (press release of volume 31, number 1)
            - v31n1s1pr (press release of volume 31, number 1, supplement 1)
            - v31n1s0pr (press release of volume 31, number 1, supplement)
            - v31s0pr (press release of volume 31, supplement)
            - v31s1pr (press release of volume 31, supplement 1)
            - v31nspepr (press release of volume 31, special number)
            - v31n3apr (press release of volume 31, number 3A)
