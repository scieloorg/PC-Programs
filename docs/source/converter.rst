5. Click on **Convert** button.

6. Converter will convert the selected files. 

    For each file, the program:

        - extracts the marked data
        - compares the issue's data in the markup file and in the issue database, managed by Title Manager->Issues. 

    If there is some conflicting data, the data are not converted to the database. It is a fatal error. The user must check and correct the data in the markup document (using Markup program) and/or in issue database (using Title Manager).

    If the issue's data is correct, the files are converted to the database and the result will be shown on the screen.

    Results:

       - successfully converted: [], in red.
       - converted, with errors: [X], in blue before its name. They have some markup errors, but not fatal enough to avoid conversion. For example, markup error, probably identified by Parser, but not corrected by the user.   
       - not converted: at the inferior part, in green. It is usually related to issue's data, such as ISSN, abbreviated title, volume and number, which do not match in the markup file and in the issue database.

7. Clicking on each file in the result area and then on **Result** button, the user can see how the conversion run.

**Converted, but no fatal error: some bibliographic references not identified**

    Converter locates each bibliographic reference of the markup file in the body file, identifying the points where **[Links]** must be inserted at the article page, in the website.
