`Read about it <concepts.html>`_.

Issue identification
--------------------

================================  ======  ==========================================
label                             field
--------------------------------  ------  ------------------------------------------ 
volume                            31
supplement of volume              131
number                            32
supplement of number              132
complement                        41
sequential number                 36      The sequential number is the year followed by the order for publication of the issue within a year.
                                          The sequential number is part of the PID of the issue. Must not be modified after publication of the issue.
                                          It also is used for the presentation of issues on the page **all** the issues, giving their order of presentation in the table.
================================  ======  ==========================================

    
Identifying regular issues
..........................

Fill the volume and number.

The sequential number is the year followed by the order of the issue within a year. Eg: 20101 (first issue within a year).

.. image:: img/en/01_iss_04.jpg


Identifying supplements
.......................

When they exist, fill volume, supplement of volume (when there is no number), number, and supplement of number.
 
If the supplement is identified only with the word **Supplement**, fill in with 0, otherwise the label which identifies the supplement, for example, 1, A, etc.

On the site, so that all supplements are presented after the regular issues within a year, the sequential numbers of the supplements must be greater than the sequential number of the last regular issue.
Eg: If there are 4 regular numbers in the year, then the sequential number for the supplements starts in 5.

.. image:: img/en/01_iss_4_supl.jpg

Identifying ahead or review / provisional issues
................................................

Fill in the **number** field the word ahead, for ahead issue. By convention its sequential number is 50.
Fill in the **number** field the word review, for review or provisional issue. By convention its sequential number is 75.

The sequential number is the year followed by the order of the issue within year, but by convention:

- Ahead is equal to 50
- Review / provisional is equal to 75 

.. image:: img/en/01_iss_04_ahead.jpg

Indentifying press release issues
.................................

Populate the same fields in accordance with the rules above, plus **pr** in the complement.
The sequential number is the year followed by the order of the issue within a year, but by **convention** starts in 100.

.. image:: img/en/01_iss_pr.jpg


Problems on filling the sequential number
-----------------------------------------

When the sequential number and the issue identification do not match, the program  presents two conflict situations:


Sequential number belonging to another issue
............................................

.. image:: img/en/01_iss_05.jpg


When the user informs a sequential belonging to another issue, the program does not open the issue data, and informs the sequential number belongs to another issue.

It is also possible that the user have misinformed the issue identification and not the sequential number.
The user is responsible for checking and correcting the data filled in before proceeding. 


Mistake or replacement?
.......................

.. image:: img/en/01_iss_06.jpg

When the user reports an issue identification and a `sequential number <concepts.html#sequential-number>`_  which do not match and the sequential number **DOES NOT BELONG TO** another issue, the program allows to:

- open the issue, using the identification informed, but correcting its sequential number 
- change the issue's sequential number to the informed one

| Note:
| The sequential number is part of the PID, so it must not be changed if the issue is already published on the site.
| The program allows the change of sequence number, if it does not belong to any other issue.
| The program does not know if the issue is already published or not. The user must be responsible for knowing it.
